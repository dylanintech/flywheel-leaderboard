# flywheel-leaderboard
flywheel is a react component library for adding dynamic leaderboards to your app. Thanks for checking it out :wave:

### Getting Started
To install the library simply run `npm i flywheel-leaderboard` or copy the command from [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/flywheel-leaderboard). 

**Don't install the github package - it will ask you for a personal access token when deploying to production. Instead install the npm package linked above.**

Note that this library only works with tailwind css (I mean if you don't get tailwind it'll still work but it'll look ugly lol) and that typescript is recommended.

I actually wrote up some sweet [docs](https://docs.myflywheel.app/) to guide you as you're getting started with flywheel and I made a quick demo if you're more of a visual learner:

**Note that the vid above is a little outdated - as of `v0.0.2` you should install the package from npm instead of from github.**
