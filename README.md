# flywheel-leaderboard
flywheel is a react component library for adding dynamic leaderboards to your app. Thanks for checking it out :wave:

### Getting Started
To install the github package simply run `npm install @dylanintech/flywheel-leaderboard`. 

Note that this library only works with tailwind css (I mean if you don't get tailwind it'll still work but it'll look ugly lol) and that typescript is recommended.

I actually wrote up some sweet [docs](https://docs.myflywheel.app/) to guide you as you're getting started with flywheel and I made a quick demo if you're more of a visual learner:
